# STL-Bus
This is an application I have been doing in my free time which allows you check the STL bus schedules in real-time using internet. 
It can also show you where the bus is in real-time using a google map fragment. There is an option that allows you to put your 
favorite stop on the main page, with arrival time estimate.
Lastly, the app will send your favorite bus stop to your android wear device, where you can also check 
the scheduled arrival times of your favorite stops and look at the bus location in a small map.
